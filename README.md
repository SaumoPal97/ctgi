=============================

This repository contains the solutions for algorithmic puzzles, interview questions, datastructure implementations and materials for basic cs concepts  for top tech companies like Google, Amazon, Twitter, Facebook, Apple, Yelp, Uber etc.

Usage
=====
###How do I see interview questions?
Interview questions for the top tech companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon, Twitter, Apple, Uber, Yelp, Nvidia are available in [com.ctgi.google.problems.questions](https://github.com/dineshappavoo/ctgi/tree/master/src/com/ctgi/google/problems/questions) folder. Files are named as COMPANY_interview_questions.gl.py.

###How do I see answers for the interview questions?
Answers for the questions are available in [com.ctgi.google.problems](https://github.com/dineshappavoo/ctgi/tree/master/src/com/ctgi/google/problems/) folder. Every question will have the java class name mentioned next to question in square bracket [].

###How do I learn about CS concepts to prepare  for top tech interviews?
Materials for computer science concepts like operating system[Semaphores, mutual exclusion, critical section etc.], networks[dhcp, dns, nat, tcp, udp, website flow etc.], bigdata[elastic search, memcache, search etc.], machine architecture[CPU, GPU, X86 etc.] are available in [com.ctgi.google.concepts](https://github.com/dineshappavoo/ctgi/tree/master/src/com/ctgi/google/concepts).

###Where can I refer datastructure implementations?
Datastructure implemantations like Hashtable, Linkedlist[Singly, Doubly, Circular], Graph, Tree,Cache[LRU, MRU] etc. in [com.ctgi.google.implementation](https://github.com/dineshappavoo/ctgi/tree/master/src/com/ctgi/google/implementation).

###Where do I learn about programming language related topics/issues?
Programming language related topics like java-[abstract classes, jvm, memory etc.], c-[compilation, macros, malloc, pointers, segmentation fault, stack/heap memory etc.] is available in [com.ctgi.google.languages](https://github.com/dineshappavoo/ctgi/tree/master/src/com/ctgi/google/languages)
