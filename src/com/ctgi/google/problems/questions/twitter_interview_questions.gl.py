1.Number of ways to tile a prism?
2.string manipulation program and remove duplicate words ? [com.ctgi.google.problems.RemoveDuplicateWords]
3.find GCD and LCM? [com.ctgi.google.problems.GCD, com.ctgi.google.problems.LCM]
4.implement some formula (x-1)! % x = -1. looks easy but for large number is runs out of memory as factorial get very big. The trick is that the formula is to check is x is prime or not.?
5.Multiply 2 integers that are arbitrarily long. They are given to you as strings, but you cannot cast them into any other data type like doubles etc.
6.Given a n-by-n matrix, each cell has a value of either 0 or 1. A cell indicates a wall if its value is 1. give the length of the shortest path from M[0][0] to M[n-1][n-1]. You can move either up, down, left or right.
7.Given a two strings, return whether the second is an anagram of a palindrome of the first string.  
8.Create an embedded list. Any element of the list can be a list and this definition applies recursively. Had to code in C. Write code to solve a maze (any language of choice)? 
9.Write a program to simulate a fair coin given two biased coins. This problem was then extended to vary the head/tail probabilities of the given coins and the coin to simulate. 
10.finding k biggest number in a list?
11.Use what data structure to solve a problem about first names and last names.?
12. Find the single number in a array, all other elements are paired.
13.Give a array A[k], define the set S{k} := { A[k], A[A[k]], A[A[A[k]]], ... }, write program to count the maximum size of Sks.?
14.Determine if a binary search tree is valid or not. ?
15.The hardest question I was hit with was to write a function   that takes an integer N and returns an NxN matrix with incrementing integers in a spiral, from outside in.
16.finding the top k items in unsorted array. Finding overlap intervals.
17.in-order iterative binary search tree traversal. 
18.implement a trie and write a 'getWithPrefix' function with a wildcard letter '*' 
19.given a vector of strings of length n with each word having a length of m on average, group all anagrams into a cluster. Do this for the case that n >>>>>> m and in the most efficient way possible. Assume extra space allowed.  
20.Find left sibling of a given node in a tree 
21.adding two large integers represented as strings together.
22.listing out all the possible combinations of a phone number where each number can be represented by letters, e.g. 1 = [A|B|C]. The followup to that question involved the scenario where the number<->letter mapping involved numbers with more than one digit, e.g. 1 = [A|B|C], 2 = [D|E|F], 12=[X|Y|Z].
23.implement isHappy() where you return false if a number whose digits squared don't add up to 1, true otherwise.
24.write the merge() portion of a mergesort.
25.listi all RHN numbers (defined as a scenario where there's a pair of unique numbers whose cube add up to the same number). 
26.Finding the longest palindrom of a string. 
27.Returning the k most frequent words in a string delimited by space.
28.1) You have a folder full of .bin files that are proprietary. 2) You have a class called converter with a "binToTSV" method which you can pass the name of a .bin file and will generate a .tsv file.3) The TSV file is a tab separated value file with a key on each line, and a value next to it spaced with a tab as such.
------- 
num_connections	65 
latency_ms	70 
bandwidth	20 
.... //etc. 
------- 
Q: Write a method to calculate the average latency and total bandwidth.

29.Write a function to find all the combinations of three numbers that sum to zero 
Sample input: 
[2, 3, 1, -2, -1, 0, 2, -3, 0] 
Sample output: 
2, -2, 0 
1, -1, 0 
3, -2, -1 
3, 0, -3 
3, 0, -3
30.write a function that has an int as input and return the equivalent String as an output 
12 -> 'twelve' 
4345 -> 'four thousand three hundred and forty-five' 
7654567643 -> 'seven billion six hundred and fifty-four million five hundred and sixty-seven thousand six hundred and forty-three'
31.You have n - 1 numbers from 1 to n. Your task is to find the missing number. 
I.e. 
n = 5 
v = [4, 2, 5, 1] 
The result is 3.
32.Given an array with numbers, your task is to find 4 numbers that will satisfy this equation: 
A + B + C = D
33.given two nodes of a binary tree, find number of nodes on the path between the two nodes.

1
     2  3
   4   5
     
     4, 3 -> (4-2-1-3): 4
