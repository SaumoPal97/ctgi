NVIDIA:
1.questions related to RTOS, was asked to write a solution for producer-consumer problem
2.bit manipulation questions like, write a macro to check if nth bit was set , write a function to count no of 1's in a variable and what was the complexity of the implementation etc.
3.Write and aligned malloc() that gets memory size needed and an alignment mask as its arguements.
4.Write a free() function to go with the aligned malloc that takes only the pointer to the allocated chunk of memory
5.C and OS question: multi-threading, semaphore, memory alignment, etc.
6.basic c++ questions, difference between shallow copy and deep copy, what is volatile mean, what is static mean, what is the difference between debug and release mode in VS, then ask to do a coding assignment, to write a malloc and free function.
7.Put 1-9 into 3x3 matrix, and have the same sum in every rows and columns and two diagonal.
8.Asked detailed questions about CPU/GPU architecture. Also, questions involving Amdahl's Law.
9.Given a 32 bit unsigned integer, write a function (in C) that returns a count of how many bits are "1"
10.What happen to stack after a function is called.
11.delete a node in list.
12.What's z buffer
13.Like explain an algorithm to show if a given set of strings is a subset of another set of strings. What is its O(n)?
14.Reverse all the bits in 32bit int
15. A question on merge sort. It was a little complicated involving two processor communication. One processor had a sorted list and the other also had a sorted list. Write a program to merge the list in a memory accessible to both the processors.
16.Why is branching a bad thing for a processor? How does it slow the process down.
17.Given that in a switch statement, there are very large number of cases(say 10000). How best can you improve the O(n)? What data structure can you implement and how. FYI, each case statement can be a function.
18. Implement a 3x3 averaging filter(not considering the center pixel) given an image,width and height. What is the minimum memory needed to perform this action
19.What is volatile keyword? When is it used?
20.Difference between ARM and Intel CPU on high level architecture. Describe I2S, I2C.
21.Substring function?. What is an interface ?? What Debugging tool would you for reverse engineering purpose to find out faults in the code.
22.There is a singly linked list of ints, write a function that takes the head pointer, and prints the list in reverse order.given 2 unsigned ints a and b, return 1 unsigned int = a/b, rounded to nearest int without float operation
23.There are 2 round of phone interview. first one consist of a lot of basic c/c++ questions as well as kernel/os basic questions like semaphone, mutual exclusion, memory allocation,etc. The second interview consist of some leadership question like how to you manage your relation with teammate or your project or your work.
24.Discribe mutual exclusion, how to implement it.
25.Write a function in C to create a new BST which is the mirror image of a given tree.
26.Consider the statement
    result = a ? b : c;
    Implement the above statement without using any conditional statements.
27.Write a multi threaded C code with one thread printing all even numbers and the other all odd numbers. The output should always be in sequence
    ie. 0,1,2,3,4....etc
