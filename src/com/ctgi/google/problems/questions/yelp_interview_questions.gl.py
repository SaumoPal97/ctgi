============
1.Given a corpus of a review, split it in terms sentences (Make sure to take care of ellipses, question marks and exclamation marks).
2.Javascript question, HTTP protocols : Their significance and difference.
3.Implement a Most Recently Used Cache.
4.Given an iterator interface for 1 word, extend to implement an iterator function for two words.
5.Implement a trie. (Write the API and code for inserting into a trie).
6.Anagrams, given an array of Strings and return all groups of strings that are anagrams.Is there any other way that don't need to sort each string.  [GroupStringsByAnagrams]
7.How does Java GC work, how to implement a GC. 
8.Using random numbers to determine value of PI(3.1518926..), and how to let it work in multi-computer environment.
9."tom" has "salad soup sandwich", "rose" has "drink soup". Input "salad sandwich" return "tom rose".
10.Given a software package depend list, like a->b, b->c, b->d, c->e, d->e, return installation sequence e,c,d,b,a.
11.Design database tables of Yelp.
12.What happens after sending an HTTP get request to yelp.com.
13.find target value from a 2d array in which each row and column are sorted.
14.Implement a cache (had growing requirements, such as a limit on how many things could be stored in it, and should return the most recently placed record).
15.Reconstruct a binary tree given two sequences of node traversals, one from inorder and one from postorder traversal. 
16.We have a fairly large log file, about 5GB. Each line of the log file contains an url which a user has visited on our site. We want to figure out what's the most popular 100 urls visited by our users.
17.How would you find the top 10 queries Yelp receives? 
18.Given two sparse Vectors, compute the Dot Product.
	Input Format : The first line will contain two numbers(k and n), which are the number of entries for the two vectors respectively.
	The next k lines are the entries for the first vector, of the form : x y where x is the position and y is the value at that position in the vector.
	The n lines are the entries of the second vector.
	Any entries not specified indicate zero at that position.
	The two vectors will always be of the same length

	Example input:
		3 3
		1 4
		4 2
		5 3
		1 7
		2 6
		5 1

	Sample Answer: Dot Product = 4*7+3*1 = 31 (only print 31) 
19.Given a company name and rank number, sort the companies by their number.
20.You have a dataset in a plain text file, and you basically have to data-structure-ize it, and sort it.
21.You have a user-submitted review (basically just a paragraph of 5ish sentences). Design and write an algorithm to break up the review into sentences, and put it in a list/array data structure. (The goal of this question, I think, was to see how you can cleverly figure out how to deal with non-standard punctuation) 
22.Parsing, data-structure-izing, and drawing conclusions from a large dataset in a plain text file. (The interviewer told me that the problem he had me solve was a real problem the engineering team encountered a few weeks back) 
23.He gave me a segment of Javascript code and asked me what it does. It was a trick question because it doesn't actually do what it seems to do.
24.You're told to make an image slideshow from a bunch of URLs in a MySQL database. Talk through how you would design the backend and frontend to do this.
25.Categorize a list of words into its anagrams
26.what happens when you type in a URL into your browser, data structures/ implementation and use, database
27.implement a function to take a collection of SET cards and identify a set if it exists or return a error status or something similar if it does not. This is according to the rules of teh game "SET" which you should look up for context.

45.Given a list of urls, find top 10 most visited urls.
46.implement the 'cd' command i.e. given a function cd('a/b','c/../d/e/../f'), where 1st param is current directory and 2nd param is the sequence of operations, find the final directory that the user will be in when the cd command is executed
47.find the sum of two integers represented as strings, return the sum as string, i.e "123" and "456" would return "579".
48.How to find the only different number in two unsorted arrays?

56.how do you find and replace a phone number from huge list of files.(your thinking approach)
57.how to design a MapReduce job for Yelp?
58.A load balancer, given [(a, 1), (b, 1), (c, 8)], a, b, c means the machine, 1, 1, 8 means 1/(1+1+8) probability returns a, 8/(1+1+8) probability return c, write code to implement the balancer. How would you test it?
59.Use map-reduce to calculate CTR of a bunch of ads. Also had to give positives and negatives of my approach.

71.What is the average disk access time? 
72.Given a big list of searches, how would you write a function that returns top 10 searches? 
73.Write a function that outputs a string that shows pagination information for a website. The string must show the current page, lowest page index, highest page index, with some "padding" around the current page.

	Example output:
		"1 ... 4 5 (6) 7 8 ... 30" for a site with 30 pages where the user is on page 6
		"1 (2) 3 4 ... 30" for a site with 30 pages where the user is on page 2
